# Fix These jQuery

These exercises go over some common jQuery "anti-patterns" -- that is, common
patterns that are actually wrong or undesirable. To work on these exercises,
view the file at `/exercises/fixing-these-jquery/fix-these-jquery.js`. You'll
see several code blocks, with instructions at the top of each. You'll work on
some of these on your own or in pairs; others we'll go over as a group in the
training.
